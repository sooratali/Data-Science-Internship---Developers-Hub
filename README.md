## üìù Task Descriptions

### Task 1: EDA and Visualization of Titanic Dataset

- **Objective:** Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data loading and cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers).
  - Visualizations: bar charts for categorical variables, histograms for numerical distributions, correlation heatmaps.
  - Summary of insights and observations.

### Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis

- **Objective:** Build a sentiment analysis model using text data.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
  - Feature engineering using TF-IDF.
  - Model training with classifiers like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes.
  - Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Task 3: Fraud Detection System

- **Objective:** Develop a system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Handling imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.
  - Model training using Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
  - Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Creation of a simple interface to test the fraud detection system.

### Task 4: Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset

- **Objective:** Implement regression models to predict house prices.
- **Key Steps:**
  - Data preprocessing: normalization of numerical features.
  - Implementation of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models from scratch.
  - Performance comparison using RMSE and R¬≤ metrics.
  - Visualization of feature importance for tree-based models.
